This is the first project game I will be working on throughout reading the book: "Learning Java by Making Android Games" by John Horton. The Game is similar to mine sweeper? I guess? We shall see!

## Description:
As far as I know now the goal of this game is to start to learn some of the basic interactions between Android DVM (Dalvik Virtual Machine) and Java/Java API's. The book depics Android as having an underlying DVM that runs as a part of Android OS. The DVM communicates with hardware and the Android OS to add a layer of abstraction between lower level machine code and the hardware on the device (just like any other OS except there is a VM running on top of a type of linux OS and the user just sees the Android OS running through the VM). From the users perspective Android OS is just like any other program running on another OS. The author also touched on Java being compiled down to DEX code (Dalvik EXecutable) which is actually what the DVM runs. 

## Goals:
Goals at this time are just simply to try to learn, document (to improve retention of the information) and progress through this project while absorbing and creating flash cards to work on memorizing any detais. This should be a fun way to not only learn Java for the first time, but also learn how Java works with Android devices!
